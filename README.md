## Overview

This repository serves as a compilation of my SQL projects. Each SQL file contains queries, data definitions, or database operations pertaining to specific project scenarios or datasets.

## Usage

To execute the SQL queries or import the database schema into your own environment, you can utilize a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Microsoft SQL Server.
